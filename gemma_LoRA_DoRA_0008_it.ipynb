        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a practical, simple case template for fine-tuning Gemma-2 models (2B, 9B, 27B) using the Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) version of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), on a free-tier Google Colab GPU.  This approach allows for efficient customization of Gemma-2 for specific tasks without the computational overhead of full fine-tuning. The basic concepts are discussed, but this notebook is meant to be a practical template for any developer at any level to be able to \"just plug and play\" without needing a PhD in math to do it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **The Problem: \"Off The Shelf\" LLMs are great, but they are jacks of all trades and masters at none:**\n",

        "Gemma-2 offers impressive performance, especially for its size, excelling at code generation, complex question answering, and following nuanced instructions.  The quality of its writing, quality of the explainations it generates, and \"human - like\" writing style is also rather impressive. However, like other pre-trained LLMs, its performance an a niche task needs to be enhanced a bit, and that is where fine-tuning on task-specific data comes in.  Traditional fine-tuning is computationally expensive, involves thousands of dollars in compute resources, and leaves a gaping carbon footprint, making it impractical for many users.\n",

        "- LoRA addresses this challenge by freezing the pre-trained model weights, in other words, basically leaving the existing model as is, and training a small set of new weights that are added in parallel to some of the model's layers.\n",
        "    - **The benefit:** This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters, enabling efficient fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. This provides almost as good accuracy as full fine tuning, and requires as little as 1% as many compute resources to accomplish.\n",
        "    - **The drawback we really want to avoid here:** The models that classic case LoRA produces is usually lower than that of full fine tuning.\n",
        "- **For advanced users:** these adapters are low rank matrices (adapter weights) injected along side specific layers, usually the query, key, and value feed forward layers.\n",

You don't really need to understand what is happening under the hood to use it. This template will is fairly robust and should work reasonably well on a lot of data sets.\n",
        "    - **The benefits:** Like conventional LoRA, we are leaving the model's original weights as - is and only training adapters that were added that account for less than 1% of the model's weights.\n",
        "    - **Unlike conventional LoRA, DoRA will often create models that are equally as accurate as those done by expensive full fine tuning**, and if not equally accurate, very close to it in most cases if done correctly and carefully optimized and on the right training data.\n",
        "- **For advanced users:\"\" What is happening is that DoRA incorporates orthogonal constraints on the adapter weights. This technique decomposes the updates of the weights into two parts, magnitude and direction. Direction is handled by normal LoRA, whereas the magnitude is handled by a separate learnable parameter. You can read more about it on the resources below, but to stay true to the scope of this notebook, to serve as a practical template and guide to arrive at a proof of concept or MVP custom LLM that can be refined later by advanced users if need be, we refer you to the paper and other academic materials rather than go deep into the details.\n",

        "## **Getting Started**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hugging Face Account and Access Token:** Create a Hugging Face account if you don't have one and generate an access token.\n",
        "    1. Account Setup: If you don't already have one, head over to the Hugging Face website (https://huggingface.co/). Create a free account.\n",
        "    2. Token Creation: Click on the button to generate a new access token. Give it any name and select the following checkboxes to give it the required permissions under the **repositories** heading:\n",
        "        1. Read access to the repos under your personal namespace.\n",
        "        2. Read access to all gated public repos you have access to.\n",
        "        3. Write access to the repos under your personal namespace.\n",
        "        4. After this, click **create token** at the bottom of the page. Paste this into a text editor, but do not save it to a file. You will need it shortly. Treat this as you would a password.\n",
        "2. **Colab Setup:** Open this notebook in Google Colab and ensure a **T4 GPU** or higher is selected (The default model should run fine wiht the free T4.).\n",
        "    1. Under **\"Runtime\"** tab -click  **\"Change runtime type\"** then select **\"T4 GPU\"**.\n",
        "3. **Access Token Secret:** In Colab, to the left of this notebook there should be a **key icon**. Click it. Click **create new secret**. Name it `ACCESS_TOKEN_HF`, use this exact name with the same uppercase and underscores. Paste your Hugging Face access token as its value, and switch the toggle switch to save it. This protects your token and passes it to the notebook so the code has access to the required resources on Huggingface.\n",
        "4. **Customize the Training Data: (Optional: You can run this notebook as is, and see this toy example run and work, but it is easy to make your own data set to solve a real problem you want to solve with a customized chatbot / LLM)**  Modify the `train_data` list to include your own dataset. Follow the provided format: `{'input': 'Your prompt or question', 'output': 'Desired LLM / chatbot response to that prompt or question'}`. Each training example is a Python dictionary that shows an example of a user prompt and a chatbot response to that prompt.\n",
        "    1.   The value associated with the \"input\" key should be an example of a prompt or a question that a user may want to ask the chatbot.\n",
        "    2. The value associated with the \"output\" should be an example of a response you would expect the chatbot to write if someone asked the chatbot that prompt or question.\n",
        "    3. Most likely, examples of prompts and responses will consist of multiple - lines of text. No problem. Just replace the line wrapping with `\\n`, so each example can be on one line and a chatbot UI will know that this means to wrap the text as a new line.\n",
        "    4. Ensure you have a sufficient amount of data for effective fine-tuning. A few hundred to a few thousand examples is recommended for ideal results, but we don't always have thet much, and that is OK. As little as 50 examples may be of some benefit, but the more examples you have, the more effective your custom chatbot will be at being true to the task you are training it to do. Use as much data as you can find and have the time to load. The vanilla example we ran only has about 100 examples, and as you can see in the results of running this, it was successful at modifying the model's behavior. Keep in mind that the more complex the instructions you want the model to be able to follow, the more exapmples it will need to be effective at the task you have in mind. Just make sure the samples follow the format:\n",
        "        1. `{'input':`\n",
        "        2.  **\"then a the example prompt or question in quotation marks\"**\n",
        "        3. then a comma `,`\n",
        "        4. then 'output:'\n",
        "        5. **\"then an example of a good response to that prompt or question in quotation marks\"**\n",
        "        6. then `}`\n",
        "        7. Each example separated by commas within the `train_data = [...]` For example:\n",
        "        ```python\n",
        "        # Make sure the samples are nested in the [] after \"train_data=\"\n",
        "        train_data = [\n",
        "             # First example\n",
        "             { # Start the example with a {\n",
        "                  'input': \"Write something to cheer someone up\", # Don't forget the comma  \n",
        "              'output':\"Don't worry. Be happy!\"\n",
        "              }, # Separate examples with a second comma\n",
        "             # Second example\n",
        "             {'input': \"Tell me something that may make someone nervous\", 'output': \"Did you hear about the storms that may be coming today?\"},\n",
        "             # And a third example:\n",
        "             {'input': \"Say something happy\", 'output': 'The sky is blue and the water is clear and warm. Dive right on in with us!'} # , ... add as many as you can\n",
        "        ]\n",
        "        \n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    6. **For advanced users: (optional to read, optional to understand):** This automatically reformats the simple dictionary of example inputs and outputs into the format: `<bos><beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n[user's prompt]<end_of_turn>\\n\\n<beginning_of_turn>model\\n\\n[intended chatbot response]<end_of_turn><eos>`.\n",
        "        1. `<bos>` means \"beginning of sample\".\n",
        "        2. `<eos>` means \"end of sample\".\n",
        "        3. `<beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n` means \"What is started on the next line is an example of a user prompt\"\n",
        "        4. `<beginning_of_turn>model\\n\\n` \"What is started on the next line is an example of a chatbot response\"\n",
        "        4. `<end_of_turn>` means end of `[user prompt | chatbot response]`\n",
        "    7. **For advanced users: (optional to read, optional to understand):**  Note that you can modify this to allow for more complex conversation examples where one example has multiple iterations of `<beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n[user prompt example]\\n\\n<end_of_turn>\\n\\n<beginning_of_turn>model [example initial response]\\n\\n<end_of_turn>\\n\\n<beginning_of_turn>user\\n\\n [example follow - up prompt or question]\\n\\n<end_of_turn>n\\n<beginning_of_turn>model\\n\\n [example response to the follow - up question]`. If you are going to train on more complex you may need to skip the step that translates the simple `{'input':'foo', \"output\":bar}` dictionaries into the formatted training data and either manually format the data accordingly or modify the code that parses and formats the training samples to accomodate however many iterations of follow - up questions you plan to include.  \n",
        "5. **Model Selection: (Optional, recommended for advanced use cases where the instructions the custom chatbot is handling are complex)** Adjust the `model_name` variable if you want to use a different Gemma-2 model (e.g., \"google/gemma-2-9b-it\", and \"google/gemma-2-27b-it\" are the larger models that perform even better).  Remember that if you want to use a larger model, you will probably need to pay for a paid tier GPU. For most simple tasks, the free tier should work jusd fine with the default model of \"google/gemma-2-2b-it.\n",
        "6. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the code cells to fine-tune your model once you have customized the training data set.\n",
        "7. **Deployment:** After training, save and commit your LoRA adapter to Hugging Face.  You can then deploy it as a REST API endpoint and integrate it with your preferred chatbot frontend or application."

        "1. **Validation:** Debug the issues that mixed precision and  quantization is creating when using a validation set with this trainer, so we can track the perplexity metric out of sample.   \n",
        "2. **Real world data:**  Adapt this to solve a real world problem.  \n",
        "3. **JSONL** Add a JSONL file loading step for training and validation data.\n",
        "4. **ETL Pipeline:** Add an ETL pipeline to make it practical to load longer input/output samples and transform them to clean JSONL samples.\n",
        "5. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  Add Optuna as a tuner and nest the training settings in a parameterized obtective() function to find the optimal hyperparameters.  Even better, set up a distributed training / tuning job with Kubeflow and Katib or with Vertex AI, etc. The hyperparameters which I guessed by rule of thumb, they clearly work for this simple example, but they may be far from perfect and suboptimal for a scaled - up data set.\n",
        "6. **MLflow Integration:**  The weights & Biases default setup works, but MLflow may provide much better ML Metadata tracking and ML artifact accessioning.\n",
